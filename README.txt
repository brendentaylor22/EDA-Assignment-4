INSTRUCTIONS

To run the code, open the R Project file "Assignment-4".
Open the file "Assignment-4-Functions" and make sure all the necessary packages are installed.

Open the file "get-clean-data" and run it.

Open the file "EDA Assignment 4 - COVID-19 Visualisation" and knit it.
	This file sources both "Assignment-4-Functions" and "get-clean-data".

	I've used the "bookdown" package as it has a nicer layout.
	The "gifski" package is also required.

	This file also has eval=FALSE by default to make knitting faster.
	You can change eval to TRUE but the animations take a while to render.
	I've saved the animations in the Gifs subfolder.

The Shiny app is in Shiny/app/app.R.
	The Shiny documentation is saved as "Shiny Documentation".
